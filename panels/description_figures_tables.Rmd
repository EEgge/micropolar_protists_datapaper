### List of interactive figures and tables from the paper: *An 18S V4 rDNA metabarcoding dataset of protist diversity in the Atlantic inflow to the Arctic Ocean, through the year and down to 1000 m depth.*

Figure 2: Profiles of environmental parameters.  
Figure 3: Rarefaction curves.  
Figure 4: Barplot of proportional read abundance in each group of a chosen taxonomic level (default division) in each size-fractionated sample.  
Figure A1: Barplot of number of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) in each group of a chosen taxonomic level (default division) in each size-fractionated sample. 

Table A1: Number of ASVs assigned to each clade of a chosen taxonomic level (default division), within each size fraction, and in total. Note that an ASV may occur in multiple size fractions.  
Table A2: Maximum and minimum read percentage of each clade of a chosen taxonomic level (default division), within each size fraction.
